    Next week we will also be satisfying class requiremetns and doing everything required to recieve the most basic credit for the class.
I will be looking at accumulated feedback and try to reflect on how to improve both our project and our report document.
    This past week we finally got all hands on deck on our report and spent several hours collaborating together and reading the entire report.
We made numerous edits and reduced wordy sections down to very concise explainations. We also removed some sections and introduced key terms
earlier.
    For the final week, we will be making any final tweaks to our revised report, and getting our final test results.
